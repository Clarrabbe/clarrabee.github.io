<!--Key Caller-->
 <!--KEY CALLERS Establishing and
maintaining a current telephone
tree is essential to providing
timely and accurate information
to Families. Reasons for using the
telephone tree range anywhere
from planning social functions,
passing on information about
meetings, deployment training,
homecomings, or emergency
information. To support this
activity it is also essential to have a
roster of volunteers who will serve
as key callers. When taking on the
FRG leader role, it is important to
find out and monitor the status
of the telephone tree operations
and issues of concern or problems
experienced and then take the
appropriate actions necessary.-->
