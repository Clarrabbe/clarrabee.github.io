        <h2 class="about me">About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                I am Crystal Larrabee. Mom of 4 and Wife to my high school sweetheart. First generation to
                    graduate high school. First generation to obtain a college degree. Army spouse for the past 15 years,
                        volunteer of
                            the quarter on Fort Riley Kansas in the first quarter of 2016. I am a graduate of Women in Operations with
                            UPS. I show up, I complete tasks,
                        when I am met with challenges I use my curiosity, persistance, and tenacioty to overcome them. I am a
                    complex problem solver
                 and I am able to perform under pressure. I live everyday intentionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                 My interests include reading, creating, and philisophical discussions. I enjoy being physically
                     active by lifting weights, hiking,
                 kayaking, and fairy gardening with my daughter.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I enjoy reading about health and wellness, how the body functions from the cellular level to the gross motor
                    skills we use in day to day life.
                        I enjoy reading about Leadership and teaching these skills to my children. I enjoy being physically active,
                            this usually turns into activities around the house.
                            My favorite subject is philosophy.
                        I donâ€™t really have time for hobbies at the moment. This is something I am actively working to change, by
                    upskilling myself to gain better employemnt
                that has a better life/work balance.
